ATSC ->advanced Televison system commitee
	This is the updated version of digital video boardcasting with HD quality and sound
DVB -> Digital video boardcasting
analog to digital-> sine wave is converted into 0's and 1's

-> The term ATSC relate to TV signals that are received over the air (known as OTA), using an antenna or aerial.
->QAM refers to TV signals that are received via cable.

HEADEND Point ->In cable TV, the head end is where the cable company locates its satellite dish and TV antenna for receiving incoming programming. In online services, the head end is the service company's computer system and databases

ATSC uses Dolby codec(an algorithm that compress and decompress the audio) for audio purpose

MPEG:Moving Picture Experts Group
(is a standard for "the generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information".It describes a combination of lossy video compression and lossy audio data compression methods, which permit storage and transmission of movies using currently available storage media and transmission bandwidth.)

TS -> Transport Stream
which is a media container format. It may contain a number of streams of audio or video content


Analog to Digital is done by sampling

	->normal sampling gives you SD qyality
	->more sampling gives tou HD quality

Digital TV advantage
	->Quadrature Amplitude Modulation(QAM)
HFC->Hybrid Fiber Cable
---------------------------------------
DBDS -> Digital Boardband Delivary System
CPE-> Customer Premises Equipment(a device kept at customer end example routers telphone,setup box)

CAS->
A Conditional Access System or a CA system uses the scrambling and encryption techniques to prevent the reception that is not authorized. 
Scrambling is a process of making the data, photos as well as music incomprehensible. Encryption on the other hand is a process of protecting the data that is sent over a network using keys. The encrypted data is transferred over a scrambled signal.

powerkey CAS 
PowerKEY Video On Demand is used in a Cisco cable environment to provide edge-encrypted video-on-demand movies and other content to subscribers.

VOD -> video On Demand(asking for a channel to the service provider and then the service provider does QAM to that channel and sents the good quality to the customer)
	this is a two way communication(switched digital video)

VSRM-> Video Session Resourse manager
AVCC-> Auxillary Video Core Ctrl

MTU-> Maximum Trasnmission Unit(maximum size of each packet in any transmission.where a 1500-byte packet is the largest allowed.)
-----------------------------------------

Headend -> it recevices signal from satillite and goes through multipke processes like QAM,SMS,encryption and then sent to the setupbox

==============================================

RPD -> Remote PHY device
	network devices located in the field closer to cable subscribers.they receive digital signal and produce 	Radio frequency that is tranmitted to through the coaxile cable to subcribers home.
	(RPD) at the network edge converts the downstream data transmitted from the core from digital to analog 	and transforms upstream
	 data from end users from analog to digital format. The RPD includes QAM modulators for downstream 	translation and QAM demodulators for upstream 	traffic. 

first we must configure the RPD and then we will receive video from auxillary video core by specifying IP address.

"Auxillary video core is s functional component that porduce,process,manage the video content and stream to end users."
core functionallity are:
	video processing	->process the video signal includes encoding decoding,transcoding
	content managagment	->manages,scheduling and controlling what is being distributed
	Multiplexing		->combing multiple video steaming to a single stream and passing through transport stream
	encryption		->encrpting the content and viewing to subscribers only
	CAS			->controlling content to be visible to subcribers
	streaming		->distribution of video content on various networks like cable,satellite,IP


	
PSI table-> Program specific information table
	provides customer oriented information to setupbox(STB)
	>Channel name
	>Channel line up
	>channel select numbers
DVB SI table
	>this table allows service providers to offer programs and services accross large
	 network that may include multiple trenasport stream.
	>enables receviers and setupbox to access info anywhere in the MPEG of muliplex
